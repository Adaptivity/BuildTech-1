This is my TO-DO List (I forget what I am suppose to do sometimes, so i use lists to keep myself in check)

Things TO-DO:

- Finish ChromaCell
- Get Started on Pipes
- Add Certain Dusts
- Create a Config Which Allows for Custom BC Recipes To Be Activated
- Create a General Config (For the Blocks, Items, e.t.c)
- Try To Make More Machines

NOTE: Anyone can help out with this, so if anyone wants, they can complete any of these things (Except for the exceptional few)
I AM NOT Saying That This Has To Be Done By The Next Release Date, But I Am Saying That If Anyonne Wants To Help Out With The Development
With The List That I made, Go Ahead, I am Not Stopping You.

BTW: THIS IS NOT The Last Things That I Will Be Implementing To My Addon, This Is What I Am Going To Do For The Next Update Or Two!
